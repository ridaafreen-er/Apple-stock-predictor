# 🍎 Apple Stock Predictor

Predict Apple stock prices using **Linear Regression** in Python! This project focuses on using the previous day’s closing price to forecast the next day’s price. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Load and preprocess Apple stock data from CSV
* Train a **Linear Regression** model
* Predict stock prices and evaluate with **Mean Squared Error**
* Visualize **actual vs predicted prices**
* Save predictions to Excel for further analysis

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** – core programming
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling and computation
* **scikit-learn** – Linear Regression & metrics
* **Matplotlib** – plotting actual vs predicted prices

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Apple-Stock-Predictor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd Apple-Stock-Predictor
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib openpyxl
```

4. Run the predictor:

```bash
python applstockpredictor.py
```

5. Check the **predictions.xlsx** file for predicted prices and view the plot for visual comparison.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads historical Apple stock prices from CSV
2. Preprocesses data (uses previous day’s close as feature)
3. Splits data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets
4. Trains a **Linear Regression** model
5. Predicts test set prices and calculates **Mean Squared Error**
6. Plots actual vs predicted prices for analysis
7. Saves predictions in **predictions.xlsx**

---

## 📈 Sample Output

* Excel file with **Date, Actual Price, Predicted Price**
* Line plot comparing **actual vs predicted stock prices**

---

## 🌟 Why This Project?

* Beginner-friendly introduction to **ML for stock prediction**
* Learn **data preprocessing, regression, evaluation, and visualization**
* Modular, reusable Python code
